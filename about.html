            <h4>What I do?</h4>
            <p>I am a person who loves technology and tries to build our relationships with it. Cities are like playground for our activities, Management of these is far from being just simple task. Though it was never meant to be complex. Urban Planning is a new domain, a field which is still young. It gives exciting chance to experiment and build newer technologies which will lead us to a better tomorrow. </p>
            <p>I have completed my undergraduate study in Urban Planning from School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal and currently pursuing City Planning from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP).</p>
            <p>It is true that planning is amalgamation of all subjects ranging from arts to technology. In rapidly growing today's scenario however, technology in form of gadgets, ICT innovations and introduction of smart techniques and methods has slowly dominated our daily life. </p>
