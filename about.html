            <h4>INVITATION</h4>
            <p>This is to thank Richa for inviting author to her hall day.  </p>
            <p>The author is sorry for behaving like a fuckin' retard in front of her and others, [Author can be asshole sometimes too]. </p>
            <p>I wish her all the pleasures of life and wish her very best of luck [though luck doesn't play any role in success, you have to try and trust your own conscience'] for all future endeavours. You have to gather all the positive energy around you and try to project it to acheive your goals in life.</p>
            <p> Author would also like to remind her that Life's too short, spend it with friends who make you laugh and feel loved. Author also requests her to follow the lines by Louis C.K which are - "Feeling unsure and lost is part of your path. Don't avoid it. See what those feelings are showing you and use it. Take a breath. You'll be okay. Even if you don't feel okay all the time". Further Author is somehow not feeling sleepy so he is busy finding some lines. Okay. Author wants her to believe that women are foolish to pretend that they are equal to men, they are far superior and always have been. This one is dedicated the author himself though "Being weird around someone is a way of letting them know that you're actually comfortable with them."  </p>
            <p>P.S. You just have to believe that even if you call me after end no. of months, that too at 4 am, I will still answer that I'll always care. That was out of context though, But author sometimes writes random shit too.
                
            <p>  ///////////////////////AND ONE SPECIAL INVITATION///////////////////  </p> 
                
            <p> Author is more than happy to invite miss Richa, Ms Kalyani and Ms Disha to MMM hall day, particularly to the area where food is gonna serve made by author and his friends. Author will also find pleasure in inviting guests to his room if it gets cleaned and arranged properly in due time. Further, guests are requested not to panic in front of Author's Friends. They are very lovely and caring. Thank You for reading all of this shit. </p>
